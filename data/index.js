            'When gripping the bar you want your shoulders to be slightly in front of bar, while you weight is still balanced over the center of your foot',

            'As the bar crosses your knees, shoot your hips forward and use your lats to pull teh bar close to your body',

            'Although in some circumstances this may be teh safest way to disengage, this can also cause lots of problems',
            'Dropping the barbell and result in damage to eth weights, potential injury and loss of additional growth',
            'As with any movement we have two phases, concentric and ecentric contraction',
